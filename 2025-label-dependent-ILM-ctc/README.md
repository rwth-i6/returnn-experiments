This folder contains information related to the Interspeech 2025 publication:

"Label-Context-Dependent Internal Language Model Estimation for CTC".

We use [RETURNN](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn) to conduct our experiments and our setups are based on [Sisyphus](https://github.com/rwth-i6/sisyphus).

Experiments for WER comparisons on in-domain and cross-domain tasks (Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper) can be found [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/i6_experiments/blob/phan_ctc_10kbpe/users/phan/configs/interspeech2025/table12.py).  
Experiments for different context lengths can be found [here](https://github.com/rwth-i6/i6_experiments/blob/phan_ctc_10kbpe/users/phan/configs/interspeech2025/table3.py).


For questions on how to setup Sisyphus and run experiments, please open an issue here or write to zyang@cs.rwth-aachen.de or minh.nghia.phan@rwth-aachen.de
