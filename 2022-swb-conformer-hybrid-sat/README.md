This repository contains configs needed to reproduce our results for our submitted paper to INTERSPEECH 2022.

Paper title: **Improving the Training Recipe for a Robust Conformer-based Hybrid Model**

### Features Extraction

We use 40-dim Gammatones features extracted using [RASR](https://github.com/rwth-i6/rasr).

### Experiments Configs

- [REURNN](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn) is used to train all models. We use [RASR](https://github.com/rwth-i6/rasr) for recognition.

- `table_X`: directory containing the configs for table(s) X in the paper
