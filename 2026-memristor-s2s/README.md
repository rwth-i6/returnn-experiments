This folder contains information related to the publication:

"Investigating the Feasibility of Executing Neural Sequence Tasks on Memristor Hardware via Physically Accurate Simulation"

The PyTorch toolkit for the simulation can be found under:
https://github.com/rwth-i6/SynaptogenML


The experiments are designed with Sisyphus in the i6-style experiment format. The following links are entry points into the experiments for the different datasets.
