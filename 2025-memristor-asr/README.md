"Running Conventional Automatic Speech Recognition on Memristor Hardware: A Simulated Approach"

The PyTorch toolkit for the simulation can be found under:
https://github.com/rwth-i6/SynaptogenML


The experiments are designed with Sisyphus in the i6-style experiment format. A starting point can be found here:
https://github.com/rwth-i6/i6_experiments/blob/main/users/hilmes/experiments/tedlium2/standalone/experiments/ctc_phon/qat.py

For questions on how to run experiments and setup Sisyphus, please open an issue here or write to [hilmes|rossenbach]@cs.rwth-aachen.de
