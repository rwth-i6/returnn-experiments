Efficient Supernet Training with Orthogonal Softmax for Scalable ASR Model Compression

We use [RETURNN](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn) for training and our setups are based on [Sisyphus](https://github.com/rwth-i6/sisyphus).

We use models parts from [i6-models](https://github.com/rwth-i6/i6_models/tree/jing-dynamic-encoder-size)
